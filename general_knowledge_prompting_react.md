# Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques: General Knowledge Prompting and ReAct  

Prompt engineering is a cornerstone of leveraging the full potential of generative AI models like GPT. Two powerful techniques, **General Knowledge Prompting** and **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)**, enable developers to create more reliable, effective, and context-aware AI systems.  

In this blog, we’ll explore these techniques, explain when to use them, and provide complete, actionable examples with code.

## **1. General Knowledge Prompting**  

**What is it?**  
General Knowledge Prompting leverages large language models' pre-trained knowledge. By framing prompts strategically, you extract factual or procedural information without extensive fine-tuning.

**When to Use:**  
- For **open-ended tasks** like answering general knowledge questions, summarization, or generating educational content.  
- To enhance domain-specific tasks by embedding general knowledge into custom workflows.  

---

### **Example: FAQ Generation for a Knowledge Base**  

#### **Scenario:**  
You are tasked with creating an FAQ section for a company's website based on general business topics.  

---

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**

#### **Install OpenAI Library**  
```bash
pip install openai
```  

#### **Code for General Knowledge Prompting**
```python
import openai

# Set up OpenAI API Key
openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"

# Define the prompt template
prompt = """
You are a knowledgeable assistant. Generate 5 FAQs with answers about the topic: {topic}.

Topic: "{topic}"
FAQs:
"""

def generate_faq(topic):
    # Use the template with the specified topic
    formatted_prompt = prompt.format(topic=topic)
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=formatted_prompt,
        max_tokens=300
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example Usage
topic = "Remote Work"
faqs = generate_faq(topic)
print(f"FAQs for {topic}:\n{faqs}")
```

#### **Output Example:**  
```
FAQs for Remote Work:  
1. What tools are essential for remote work?  
   - Essential tools include communication platforms (Zoom, Slack), project management software (Trello, Asana), and reliable internet access.  

2. How can I stay productive while working remotely?  
   - Maintain a dedicated workspace, establish a routine, and set clear goals for the day.  

3. What are the benefits of remote work?  
   - Benefits include flexibility, cost savings, and reduced commuting time.  
```

## **2. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)**  

**What is it?**  
ReAct combines **reasoning** (logical thought processes) with **acting** (taking actions based on reasoning) to improve multi-step task-solving. The model first explains its reasoning process before performing the action, resulting in greater interpretability.  

**When to Use:**  
- For **complex workflows** requiring multi-step reasoning (e.g., calculations, decision-making, dynamic task execution).  
- To enhance **interpretability** in AI-driven processes by showing the reasoning behind decisions.  

---

### **Example: Multi-Step Math Problem Solving**  

#### **Scenario:**  
You want to solve a math problem where the AI needs to reason through the solution steps.  

---

### **Step-by-Step Implementation**

#### **Define ReAct Prompts**
```python
react_prompt = """
You are an assistant capable of reasoning step-by-step to solve problems.  
Provide reasoning first, then give the final answer.

Problem: {problem}
Step-by-step reasoning and answer:
"""
```

---

#### **Code for ReAct Prompting**
```python
def solve_problem(problem):
    # Format the ReAct prompt
    formatted_prompt = react_prompt.format(problem=problem)
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=formatted_prompt,
        max_tokens=200
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example Usage
problem = "If a car travels 60 miles in 1.5 hours, what is its average speed?"
solution = solve_problem(problem)
print(f"Solution:\n{solution}")
```

#### **Output Example:**  
```
Solution:  
Step-by-step reasoning and answer:  
1. To calculate the average speed, divide the total distance by the total time.  
2. Total distance = 60 miles, Total time = 1.5 hours.  
3. Average speed = 60 miles ÷ 1.5 hours = 40 miles per hour.  

Final Answer: 40 miles per hour.  
```

## **3. Combining General Knowledge Prompting and ReAct**  

### **Scenario:**  
You are building an AI-powered **research assistant** that generates knowledge-based insights and answers questions requiring reasoning.  

---

#### **Full Code Example**  
```python
def generate_insight_and_reason(topic, question):
    # General Knowledge Prompt
    general_prompt = f"Provide a brief insight on the topic: {topic}."
    general_response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=general_prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    ).choices[0].text.strip()

    # ReAct Prompt for Question Answering
    react_prompt = f"""
    You are a reasoning assistant. Based on the insight "{general_response}", answer the following question:
    {question}

    Step-by-step reasoning and answer:
    """
    react_response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=react_prompt,
        max_tokens=300
    ).choices[0].text.strip()

    return general_response, react_response

# Example Usage
topic = "Climate Change"
question = "What are the main causes of climate change?"
insight, reasoning_answer = generate_insight_and_reason(topic, question)

print(f"Insight on {topic}:\n{insight}\n")
print(f"Reasoning and Answer:\n{reasoning_answer}\n")
```

---

#### **Output Example:**  
```
Insight on Climate Change:  
Climate change refers to significant alterations in global weather patterns over time, primarily driven by human activities such as fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial emissions.

Reasoning and Answer:  
Step-by-step reasoning and answer:  
1. The main causes of climate change are human activities, particularly those that increase greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.  
2. Fossil fuel combustion releases carbon dioxide and methane, which trap heat.  
3. Deforestation reduces the number of trees that can absorb carbon dioxide.  

Final Answer: The main causes of climate change are fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial emissions.  
```
